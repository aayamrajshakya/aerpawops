## SAM4 Software Setup

### Mission Planner Setup and Firmware Install

1. Initially, this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oqh-XCiEeKN5vtyqlTcJUfF9Hhv8CYBJvTP91v279U0/edit#gid=665594915) was followed. It is a spreadsheet with steps to configure the [Cube Orange](https://www.cubepilot.com/#/home) autopilot and the ESCs. There are a few hang-ups, so this article is being created to transfer that knowledge to Confluence while updating the information in the spreadsheet.

2. Install Mission Planner.  
   a. [Link to installation page](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html)

3. Connect laptop USB to the autopilot through the carrier boardâ€™s micro USB.  
   a. The USB power is enough to power on the autopilot at this point.  
   b. The carrier board micro USB is underneath the GPS.  
   c. `<Insert image of port>`

4. **Do we need a fork to distinguish between a clean cube vs a cube with existing firmware?**

5. Install rover firmware.  
   a. This step is required before installing copter firmware. Installing the rover firmware over pre-existing copter firmware will reset the parameters.
